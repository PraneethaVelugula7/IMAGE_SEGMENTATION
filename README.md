#Image Classification with CNN
  
Built an Image Classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Model trained to classify images into multiple categories (e.g., cats, dogs, objects).

Implemented using TensorFlow / Keras for deep learning.

Integrated with Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

Users can upload an image and view real-time predictions.

Achieved high accuracy through data preprocessing, augmentation, and optimization.

Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and demonstration.
